# An-Educational-Chatbot-for-Answering-Queries

### Proposed Framework
In this project we create a chatbot for the healthcare system. We have created a dataset containing conversations between user and chatbot and by using K-Means text clustering algorithm we create clusters for the user queries and tag them with the closest cluster indices. For new data we can predict the cluster index the test samples are closest to and check if our system is working or not.
