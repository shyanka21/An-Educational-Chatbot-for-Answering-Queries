# An-Educational-Chatbot-for-Answering-Queries

### Proposed Framework
In this project a chatbot was created for the healthcare system. The dataset contained conversations between user and chatbot and by using K-Means text clustering algorithm clusters were created for the user queries and tagged with the closest cluster indices. For new data the cluster index was predicted for the test samples to check if the system was working or not.
